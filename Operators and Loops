Conditional operators include || and && which are 'or' and 'and' 
respectively. Operators include -, +, /, and * to subtract, add, 
divide, and multiply respectively. % is called the modulo operator
and returns the remainder in a division operation. Other operators 
include conditional, logical, assignment, and comparison operators.
++ and -- dincrease and decrease by 1 respecively.

=== compares valeue and type while == compares value. eg 3=='3' is 
going to be true because only values are compared which is 3. 3==='3' 
equalls false because you ar comparing vale and type and since the 
value is the same, the type is not. You are compering a string with a number.
! is used to negate, = is the assignment operator, < means less than, > means greater than.

For loop follows this syntax
for(var x = 0; x<5; x++){
//block of code
}
while while loop foloows this syntax
var x = 0
while(x < 5){
//block of code
x+
}

Loops are used to repeat a proces for a certain number of times
without repeating the code. In some cases, it can work like a 
recursive function.
