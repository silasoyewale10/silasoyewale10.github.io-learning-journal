Javascript is an object oriented language that is capable of 
interacting directly to web pages making it a tool of choice 
for front end developers. Javascript has robust in-built functions
while also allowing programmers to create their own functions.

The syntax to declare a function varies but the most commonly used one is:
function greet(name){
//block of code
//optional return statement
}
greet()
A function needs to be called to execute the content of the code. 
Also, a function can be anonymous. A key importance of functions
is that they help us to divide huge programs into manageable chunks
of code called functions that make manipulating code easier and less 
redundant.

Though it was initially thought of as a client-side web browser language
but its now actively being used on the server-side, databases, and in 
non-web programs and mobile applications. Vanilla JS is a Javascript 
not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries.
