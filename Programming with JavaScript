Javascript is an object oriented language that is capable of 
interacting directly to web pages making it a tool of choice 
for front end developers. Javascript has robust in-built functions
while also allowing programmers to create their own functions.
For and while loops are used in Javascript.  

Conditional operators include || and && which are 'or' and 'and' 
respectively. Operators include -, +, /, and * to subtract, add, 
divide, and multiply respectively. % is called the modulo operator
and returns the remainder in a division operation. Other operators 
include conditional, logical, assignment, and comparison operators.
