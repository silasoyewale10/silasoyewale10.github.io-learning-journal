Input storage processing and output are the four capablities of everycomputer. 
It seems easy but extremely complicated. Computers used to be gigantic, 
as big as a room, and only capable of doing basic problems. Calculators
are like earliest calculators and have morphed into more sophisticated 
tools now. Computers take input and changes the input using algorithms
(instructions). This algorithms determine the output. 

Computers only understand binary language not human language.
Computer languages are similar to human languages and are 
converted to binary during execution. Electric wires carry 
electricity which represent bits in a computer.I also learned
how to convert binary to decimal and vice versa. Words are converted
to binary based on their postition in the alphabet. Photos and videos
contain pixels which contain colors which ahve numbers. Sound is a
vibration which is a wave and each point on the wave is a number. Essentially, 
everything on the computer is in binaries of either 0 or 1.
