CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is the driving force
behind an attractive user interface. Essentially, everything 
on the web page is treated as a box and CSS allows us to 
manipulate the different attributes of each box. A tasteless 
website without sophisticated CSS input will drive users to 
other websites wit attractive interface.

CSS has categories like font, dimensions, borders, background,
position, float etc which can be adjusted. There are different 
selectors which determine what is going to be affected by our 
adjustments. Element, class, ID,universal, and group selectors 
are the examples of selectors in CSS and their names indicate 
what they select.
