Summary of What I Learnt in Git Intro

A remote repository is a version of a project residing online 
or on a network. Git allows developers to collaborate on the same project
while keeping accurate track of their joint and individual progresses.

Key words and their meanins include:

1. Cloning: Creating a copy of an existing repo. Command is git clone

2. Committing: Gluing a message to a change. The command is git commit

3. Pushing: Moving changes to the remote repository. The command is git push

Other notable commands are:
