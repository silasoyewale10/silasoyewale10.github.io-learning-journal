Markdown is a way of styling texts on the web on github.
These styling is done through non-alphabetic characters. 
Some of the stylings that can be done are bold, italics, quote, paragraphs etc. 
These stylings are done in the edit new file and the results are viewed in the preview. 
After the page has been styled to one's taste, one can commit the page to save the changes made to the page.  

You can format codes too without losing the code's indentation
or the code's original appearance in a text editor. To do this,
include ``` pasted code ``` to manintain the format. 
For instance this piece of code 


```function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    } ```
    
    will show as
    
    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
