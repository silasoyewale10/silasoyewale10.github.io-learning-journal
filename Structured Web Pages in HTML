I leanrt very valuable leassons from this part. HTML is a 
markup language thatprovides structure to the web page. It
is the component of the web visible to the user and needs 
to be structured propery in order to achieve desired results. 
The layout can be the difference between getting more visitors
or not.

HTML has basic features including title tag,
header tag, and the body tag. The header is 
the title which usually runs across the head 
of the page. The title is the name of the page
and the body is the main content of the page. 
HTML also sets the attributes of a web page like font.
