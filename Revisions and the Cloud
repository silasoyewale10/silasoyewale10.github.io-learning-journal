      What this thought me is that I can have multiple pages
  in one repository and I can only use markdown syntax 
  for a file ending with .md extension.
  Also, I learnt that when I commit, I can include a 
  commit message. Interestingly, in VS Code, git clone urlofrepository 
  will clone the repository to my computer while perfectly
  maintaining the file structure. 
  It is extremely important to commit after every change and
  the commit message should detail why the changes were made, not what 
  changes were made.
