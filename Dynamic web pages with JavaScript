Interestingly, HTML, CSS and Javascript work together
to create a dynamic and attrcative website. This 
combination of the three allows us to make web pages
dynamic and eliminated the problem of creating static
web pages for each user. Integrating  JS into HTML, a
document object model needs to be made for the HTML 
document. In DOM, the document is represented as nodes
and objects which are accessed by JS to manipulate the document. 

Javascript can be used to create an alert on a click or 
button inside an HTML document and other valuable JS 
functions can be called as well. While it may look 
complicated at first trying to wrap my mind around 
how this works, it gets easier with time.
